## Universal Software Framework 

### The code is:

- an honest attempt to create something beautiful
- a platform for quickly building computer programs
- an expression of the same idea in multiple languages
- my gift to the world

### The code is not:

- perfect

---
    
#### tenets:

- use core features of a language, avoid third party libraries
- consider a change for one language, then make the change for all languages
- the code should explain itself well enough to avoid redundant comments
- consistency for naming, spacing, comments, and indentation is good
- the mind should remain fluid and formless at all times
- *never quit*
