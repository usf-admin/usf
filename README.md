## Universal Software Framework 

### The code is:

- An honest attempt to create something beautiful
- A platform for quickly building computer programs
- An expression of the same idea in multiple languages
- My gift to the world

### The code is not:

- Perfect

---
    
#### Axioms:

- The code should explain itself well enough to avoid redundant comments
- Consistency for naming, spacing, comments, and indentation is good
- The mind should remain fluid and formless at all times
- Anything is possible

#### Tenets:

- Use core features of a language, avoid third party libraries
- Consider a change for one language, then make the change for all languages
- Never quit
